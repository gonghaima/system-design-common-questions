I am preparing interviews for system design. Can you give me a new common system design question?
Checking existing questions in this folder /Users/stevengong/study/system-design-common-questions/

follow the same pattern for URL_Shortening, Cache_Request_Surge in /Users/stevengong/study/system-design-common-questions/, can you create folders and file for "Design a Rate Limiter Service".

for "URL shortening", can you update /Users/stevengong/study/system-design-common-questions/URL_Shortening/URL_Shortening.md , include the steps/ strategy to answer and interact with interviewer?
